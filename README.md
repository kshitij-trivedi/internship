## Documentation

[Documentation](https://linktodocumentation)

In this project i had created a register page for the new user and then a log in page for the existing user and register user and then finally a image upload page so then a user can upload a image with a logout button that will redirect you to the login page 

As this image upload page is fully authincated no one can just simplly click on the link of the local host(http://127.0.0.1:8000/) and directly access the image upload page .If you even know the link of the image upload page then too it will redirectyou to the login page 

to access the admin pannel one can use username-admin and password -1234 or can simply create a superuser by using python manage.py createsuperuser command

and the user first need to install django in the IDE so that they can run the code to istall django user can user pip install django command because i have used django as framework.
